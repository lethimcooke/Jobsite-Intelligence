  Read and search the public web from this cloud session through Agent Reach's
  zero-config channels: read any URL as clean text (Jina Reader), Exa web search
  (via mcporter), RSS/Atom feeds (feedparser), YouTube subtitles (yt-dlp).
  Use when Jobsite Intelligence work needs outside web context: checking a hauler's own
  website for a nameable job, reading a business or news page about a project,
  finding a source a filing doesn't give, or researching a vendor/competitor.
  NOT for TCEQ (data.texas.gov) or FMCSA pulls:
  use the repo scripts in scripts/ for those. NOT for Gmail, GitHub
  (use gh api / GitHub MCP tools), or any login-backed platform (Twitter,
  Reddit, XiaoHongShu, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Boss): those are not
  installed in this environment and must not be configured.

# Project overlay (Jobsite Intelligence, cloud environment)

Read this first. The upstream skill text follows below, unchanged.

**What is installed** (by `scripts/cloud_setup.sh`, run as the environment setup script):
`agent-reach` 1.5.0 CLI, `yt-dlp`, `mcporter` 0.14.2 with an `exa` entry. If
`agent-reach` is missing, the setup script did not run: say so and stop; do not
`pip install` it into the repo.

**Verified working here (2026-10-07):** web (Jina Reader), RSS, YouTube
subtitles, V2EX, Bilibili search. Exa search works but keyless use is
rate-limited intermittently ("You've hit Exa's free MCP rate limit"); on that
message, fall back to Jina Reader on a known URL or to WebSearch, and tell the
user. A key can be added via the `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable.

**GitHub:** `gh` here is Claude Code's built-in shim, not the GitHub CLI.
Doctor reports the GitHub channel as an error; that is expected. Use
`gh api <endpoint>` or the GitHub MCP tools, and only for repos in this
session's scope. Ignore upstream `gh repo view` / `gh search` commands.

**Out of scope here:** every login-backed channel (cookies, browser sessions,
OpenCLI, Boss Chrome profile). Never ask the user for cookies and never run
`agent-reach install --system --channels=...`.

**Project rules that still apply to anything you read:**
- Facts for copy come only from public filings and the business's own public
  pages. Web results are leads to verify, not facts to quote.
- Never write that construction has started, that a vendor is unselected, or
  that hauling is open for bid, whatever a web page says.
- Don't name individuals in copy.
- Temporary output goes to the session scratchpad or `/tmp`, never the repo
  (matches the upstream "never create files in the workspace" rule).

**Health check:** `agent-reach doctor --json` (read-only).

# Upstream skill (Agent Reach SKILL_en.md, unchanged below)

# Agent Reach — internet capability router

16 platforms, multiple backends each. **When this skill exists, use it for
these platforms — do not invent your own approach.**

## Standing rules (apply for the whole session)

1. **Health-check before acting**: for multi-backend/login-backed platforms (XiaoHongShu /
   Reddit / Bilibili / Twitter / Facebook / Instagram), run `agent-reach doctor --json` first.
   Use a populated `active_backend`; `active_backend: null` means Doctor deliberately skipped a
   live probe to avoid browser-cookie reads or remote writes, not that no backend exists. Only when
   the user's task requires that platform, run the reference's read-only command to verify it.
2. **Announce what you use**: say "using agent-reach, platform X via backend Y"
   before starting.
3. **On failure, follow the retry chains in references/** — never guess
   commands.
4. **For broad research tasks**: combine platforms (Exa for web search +
   Twitter/Reddit for discussions + XiaoHongShu/Bilibili for Chinese
   perspectives), collect in parallel, then synthesize.
5. **Watch versions for the user**: after finishing a substantial
   multi-platform task, run `agent-reach check-update` (fast, one API call).
   If a new version exists, append one line to your wrap-up: "Agent Reach
   vX.Y.Z is available — paste this to me to update: 帮我更新 Agent Reach：
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/update.md".
   Never interrupt the current task to update; never nag about the same version twice.

## Routing table

| User intent | Category | Details |
|---------|------|---------|
| Web / code search | search | [references/search.md](references/search.md) |
| XiaoHongShu / Twitter / Bilibili / V2EX / Reddit / Facebook / Instagram | social | [references/social.md](references/social.md) |
| Jobs / LinkedIn | career | [references/career.md](references/career.md) |
| GitHub / code | dev | [references/dev.md](references/dev.md) |
| Web pages / articles / RSS | web | [references/web.md](references/web.md) |
| YouTube / Bilibili / podcast transcripts | video | [references/video.md](references/video.md) |
| Xueqiu / stock quotes | finance | [references/finance.md](references/finance.md) |

## Zero-config quick commands

```bash
# Exa web search
mcporter call exa.web_search_exa query="query" numResults=5

# Read any web page
curl -s "https://r.jina.ai/URL"

# GitHub search
gh search repos "query" --sort stars --limit 10

# YouTube subtitles (never use yt-dlp for Bilibili; retry chain in video.md)
yt-dlp --write-sub --write-auto-sub --skip-download -o "/tmp/%(id)s" "URL"

# V2EX hot topics
curl -s "https://www.v2ex.com/api/topics/hot.json" -H "User-Agent: agent-reach/1.0"

# Bilibili search (bili-cli, no login needed)
bili search "query" --type video -n 5
```

## Login-backed platforms (pick by doctor's active_backend)

Twitter boundary: cookies saved by `agent-reach configure twitter-cookies`
are used only by `doctor` to check whether explicit credentials are present.
`doctor` does not run `twitter status` or configure the current shell. Before
calling `twitter` directly, explicitly provide `TWITTER_AUTH_TOKEN` and
`TWITTER_CT0` in the child-process environment without logging their values.

XiaoHongShu boundary: Agent Reach must not log the user in or read browser
cookies. OpenCLI may use only an existing Chrome session explicitly controlled
by the user. If none exists, do not automate login; use a manual Cookie-Editor
export with xiaohongshu-mcp or a legacy tool instead.

```bash
# Twitter search (twitter-cli preferred; retry chain in social.md)
twitter search "query" -n 10

# Reddit (NO zero-config path — OpenCLI or rdt-cli, login required)
opencli reddit search "query" -f yaml   # desktop
rdt search "query" --limit 10            # legacy/server

# XiaoHongShu (desktop prefers OpenCLI)
opencli xiaohongshu search "query" -f yaml

# Facebook / Instagram (desktop OpenCLI, browser session)
opencli facebook search "query" -f yaml
opencli facebook groups -f yaml
opencli instagram search "query" -f yaml       # user search
opencli instagram user USERNAME -f yaml        # recent posts from one user
```

## Environment check

```bash
# Channel availability + which backend serves each platform
agent-reach doctor --json
```

When the user asks “help me configure Boss Zhipin” / “帮我配 Boss直聘”, read the
Boss section in `references/career.md`. After explicit install approval, run
`agent-reach install --env=local --system --channels=boss`, launch the dedicated
loopback-only Chrome profile for their OS, then **pause and have the user visually
confirm** the window is logged in (avatar in the top-right); if not, have them log
in manually. Then verify with `boss --cdp-url http://localhost:9222 login --cdp`
and `agent-reach doctor`. Do not make the user assemble CDP flags.
Keep reusing the dedicated Chrome profile; do not recreate it for every run or
switch to the user's daily profile by default. Search with
`boss --browser-source existing-browser --cdp-url http://localhost:9222 search ...`.
On `ENVIRONMENT_RISK`, stop without refreshing, relogging, or retrying.

**Do not trust `boss status` for CDP browser login state** — it only validates the
local `~/.boss-agent/auth/session.enc` store, which does not represent the
dedicated Chrome profile's cookies that `existing-browser` searches actually use. Use
the browser `wt2` cookie probe in `agent-reach doctor` plus the user's visual
confirmation. Never judge login state from the page URL: `security-check` /
`zhipin-security` / `_security_check` pages are anti-bot challenges that appear
even when logged in. `AUTH_EXPIRED` from a search is the ground truth for a
logged-out browser — go straight to the login flow + `login --cdp` instead of
interpreting it as a security check.

## Discovering OpenCLI adapters

When the routing table lacks a needed platform or command, run `opencli list`,
then inspect `opencli <platform> --help`. Discovery proves only that an adapter
exists, not that authentication or target content works. Run read-only commands
only when the user's task requires that platform, and require non-empty content.

## Workspace rules

**Never create files in the agent workspace.** Use `/tmp/` for temporary
output and `~/.agent-reach/` for persistent data.

## Detailed references

Read the matching file when you need specifics (commands above cover the
common cases; references hold per-backend command groups, caveats, retry
chains — note: reference docs are written in Chinese, commands are universal):

- [Search](references/search.md) — Exa AI search
- [Social](references/social.md) — XiaoHongShu, Twitter, Bilibili, V2EX, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram (multi-backend/login-backed groups)
- [Career](references/career.md) — LinkedIn
- [Dev](references/dev.md) — GitHub CLI
- [Web](references/web.md) — Jina Reader, RSS
- [Video](references/video.md) — YouTube, Bilibili, Xiaoyuzhou
- [Finance](references/finance.md) — Xueqiu quotes, search and market content

## Configure a channel

If a channel needs setup, fetch the install guide:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md

The user only provides cookies / one extension click; the agent does the rest.
